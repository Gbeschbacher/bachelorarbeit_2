#bachelorarbeit_2
================





###How to use project:
======================

1. enable the following flags
  - activate HTML-Imports (for HTML Imports)
  - Enable experimental Web Platform features (for Custom Elements)

2. To be able to watch the polymer examples, you need to have bower installed ([Click here to get Bower](http://bower.io/))
 - Switch into the directory and type `bower install`

3. Move the whole bachelorarbeit_2 repository in /var/www (or wherever your localhost is installed etc.) --> Endresult: The files need to be available like follows: `http://localhost/bachelorarbeit_2/praxisprojekt`
This is a really important step because else you are going to have CORS-Problems (if you use standard browser-security options) 

4. Everything is up and ready to run!
